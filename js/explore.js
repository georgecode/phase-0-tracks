/*I'll entertain you with the sudo code and the ugly solution asked for, but than i'll add a more eloquent way solution below
1. create an empty function with a string
2. convert the string into a split array
3. loop through the letters of the array
  3.1 reomve a letter off the back of the split array
  3.2 add the removed letter to a new array
4. join the new array
5. output the new array*/
