2. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

sqlite> SELECT * FROM reviews JOIN users, businesses
   ...> ON reviews.user_id = users.id AND reviews.business_id=businesses.id;

1|5|Great food!|1|1|1|Bradford|Pitt|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel
2|4|Good food!|2|2|2|MAndy|Kaling|2|Amir's Towing
3|3|Ok food!|3|3|3|Angela|Jolie|3|The Beagle Nightclub
4|1|Bad food!|4|4|4|Steven|Wonder|4|Lotus Yoga

---------------------

3. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

sqlite> SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, stars, comment From reviews
   ...> JOIN users, businesses ON reviews.user_id = users.id AND reviews.business_id = businesses.id;

Bradford|Pitt|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|5|Great food!
MAndy|Kaling|Amir's Towing|4|Good food!
Angela|Jolie|The Beagle Nightclub|3|Ok food!
Steven|Wonder|Lotus Yoga|1|Bad food!

---------------------

4. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?

sqlite> SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, stars, comment From reviews
   ...> JOIN users, businesses ON reviews.user_id = users.id AND reviews.business_id = businesses.id WHERE businesses.name = "Amir's Towing";

MAndy|Kaling|Amir's Towing|4|Good food!
